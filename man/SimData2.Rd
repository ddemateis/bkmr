\arguments{
\item{opt}{Simulation scenario option: 1 for no modification, 2 for opposite effects, 3 for an effect in one group, and 4 for a scaled effect between groups}

\item{SNR}{signal-to-noise ratio}

\item{bin_mod}{0 for group 1, 1 for group 2}

\item{mod_DGM}{indicator for including modifier in data generating mechanism}
}
